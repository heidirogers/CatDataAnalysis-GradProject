# Categorical Data Analysis-  Graduate Project
This project was completed for the graduate project in Stat 543, categorical data analysis, and looks at online shopper behavior to ultimately predict when a internet user will make a purchase. This study implements a large amount of exploratory data analysis to identify underlying data trends, and compares a logistic regression and random forest model with regard to prediction performance metrics. Additionally, this project investigates techniques for dealing with imbalanced data sets, and overall visualizes model results and discusses the influence of independent variables in terms of odds ratios.

### Data
The data for this project includes a single csv file containing rows of observations for each online user.
